Modify ServoTimers.h (should be in user/documents/Arduino/libraries/Servo/src/avr/ or programs/Arduino/libraries/Servo/src/avr) to use timer3 instead of timer1:

#elif defined(__AVR_ATmega32U4__)
#define _useTimer3
typedef enum { _timer3, _Nbr_16timers } timer16_Sequence_t;

This is because Radiohead uses timer1. It has a flag to use timer2 instead, but the Arduino Leonardo (Pro Micro) doesn't have timer2, just timer1, timer3, and timer4.

If duplicate libraries exist, some will have to be renamed to avoid conflicts

Arduino board can't power servo and receiver, so must use external power. Servo ground must be tied to board ground.
